Nadia Eghbal's book "Working in Public" takes a deep dive into how open source software really works. It's not all about the codingâ€”what really powers these projects are the communities behind them. These groups do more than just code; they write helpful guides, talk over key issues, and support each other, which is crucial for any successful software project.

The book looks closely at how big projects, like the Linux kernel, thrive thanks to this community effort. It's not just about how much you know technically; it's also about how well you can work with others to keep improving and growing the project.

Eghbal argues that the future of open source relies on recognizing and appreciating these community efforts just as much as the technical skills. She believes that understanding this community element is key to seeing why open source is such a strong way for people to work together and innovate. This book is a great resource for anyone who wants to get a real sense of what makes open source projects succeed.
