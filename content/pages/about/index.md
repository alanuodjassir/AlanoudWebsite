<H3> Hello 🙋🏻‍♀️ </H3>

I'm a Computer Science student deeply interested in programming and the art of creating enjoyable user experiences (UI/UX). While my academic journey is still ongoing, I'm actively exploring various domains within technology, such as

Programming The joy of coding and bringing ideas to reality. </br>
iOS (SwiftUI and UIKit)  </br>
UI/UX Design The process of designing user interfaces that are not only functional but also delightful to interact with. </br>
I am passionate about learning and applying my knowledge to solve real-world problems, always aiming to bridge the gap between user needs and the technical world.
